The increase is driven by three primary factors:\n\n(1) **Q4 SPIFF accelerator program** ($3.5M): Board-approved Enterprise deal acceleration program running October through December. Approved by CRO on September 15, 2024. Related finding: Commission rate override not reverted for one account executive (REV-2024-0014, $31.2K impact, clawback in process).\n\n(2) **Annual customer conference** ($1.8M): Annual event held November 12-14 in San Francisco. Within the $2M approved budget.\n\n(3) **Higher sales commissions** ($1.2M): Variable compensation increase tied to 14.7% Q4 revenue growth. Commission rates verified against approved plan.\n\n(4) **Digital advertising** ($0.5M): Incremental spend for Enterprise Platform v3.0 launch campaign.\n\n**Conclusion**: Variance is explained and supported by approved programs. No further action required beyond monitoring the commission override clawback resolution.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to update the flux analysis record with this commentary?",
